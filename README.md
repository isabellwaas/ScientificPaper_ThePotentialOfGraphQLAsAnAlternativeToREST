# Introduction
This repository contains a scientific paper that I wrote in German during my Master's programme at Hof University of Applied Sciences in the lecture "New Technologies in Computer Science". It looks at two technologies for implementing APIs, REST and GraphQL. Then it compares them based on various criteria. Finally, a conclusion is drawn as to whether GraphQL is an appropriate alternative to REST.
